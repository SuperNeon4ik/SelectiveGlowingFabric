# Selective Glowing (Fabric)
Comically simple server mod to apply fake glowing to players. 

### Usage
There's only one command, that controls everything.
```
/glow <target: player> <displayplayers: players>
```
`target` - player, that is glowing.\
`displayplayers` - players, that will see the `target` glowing. (command *overrides* old `displayplayers`)

Reset glowing for target with this command.
```
/glow <target: player> *reset
```
Or reset all glowing targets with this command.
```
/glow *reset
```
